        <h4>Greetings from Bellingham, Washington. 2020 had one last surprise in store and dumped a tasteful bit of snow the other day (peep the background video). This and the 
            skyrocketing price of lumbar prompted us to make a digital Christmas card. Plus, Henry is trying to become a web developer or something 
            like that so please enjoy each of our digitally presented POVs on 2020. At the very least, this will be easier to discard than traditional 
            stationary. We wish you all good health and good fortune and are missing the faces we’d normally see this time of year! 
            <br>
            <br>
            With Love, 
            Lori, Bart, Will and Henry.

        <h4>Lori turned 60 in May and had big plans for an epic celebration involving driving a camper van around the 4 Corners. Unfortunately, 
            the rocks and trees of the parks contracted COVID so she instead completed a 60 kilometer run/walk from her front door into the Chuckanut 
            Mountain trails (her favorite running haunts) and back. Immediately followed by several drinks on the couch – coincidentally a common pastime of 
            her two freeloading sons. The rest of the year she spent in the kitchen perfecting everything from vegan pizza to dehydrated dinners for 
            Bart’s summer adventure (see Bart story). 
            <br>
            <br>
            There was also an unusual episode during the spring and summer where Lori would obsess over chess, yes you read that right, chess. LoJo60, 
            as she is known on Chess.com used to spend hours dueling Russia’s finest on the internet and to this day sometimes still accepts challenges 
            from anyone with a hankering. Other notable hobbies include exploring the San Juan Islands from the little boat, Redfish. After two years of 
            experience she is proud to hold the position of head anchor dropper.

        <h4>The most wonderful part of 2020 is having Henry here full-time and 
            Will here part-time. They have brought a lot of joy and pleasure. I feel proud they want to be here. It couldn’t be for the free 
            rent and board and all those beers…could it? No! That’s just a little icing on the cake. I wonder what we’ll do when things return to 
            normal and they move on. I know I’ll miss them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By mid-summer I needed a change of scenery and a challenge so I embarked on a solo-backpacking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail from Rainy 
            Pass, WA to the Columbia River, a 443-mile trek.  I hiked for 24 days and 313 miles before forest fires ended my trek on Sep 11. It was quite 
            a ride and I loved most every minute of it. I came away with a lot of positive introspection and a desire to do more of this in the future. 
            I would highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested.
            <br>
            <br>
            What I miss most is being social, having folks over for dinner or meeting friends for wine. Hopefully by this time next year things will be 
            back to normal and we can revel in the everyday joys of life once again!
            <br>
            <br>
            Best to you all!

        <h4>
            Henry began the year as a bartender, facilitating the intoxication of Bellevue’s finest. When Covid struck he moved in with his parents and lived 
            the classic unemployed millennial life… trading volatile stock options with his life savings. Through the glorious ups and the awful downs of 
            trading he realized that his successes were mostly due to luck and his failures were mostly due to being an awful trader. Not seeing this as a 
            viable long term arrangement, he sought out rudimentary office jobs at financial firms in the Seattle area. This did not go well. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After getting spurned by all manner of employers Henry was forced to look inward, and he eventually realized that he didn’t want to work in 
            finance after all. What he wanted, was to be a coder. Like a man who picks up the last blanket in the house after searching for his phone for an 
            hour, and notices the comforting glint of a reflective screen… Henry feels that after years of searching, this will be the career that truly suits 
            him. He is currently learning as much as he can about basic web design and plans to take college courses this Winter. He’s committed himself to many 
            pursuits this year and has tryed to stay busy, however, those close to him will tell you, that his greatest achievement by far was collecting federally 
            enhanced unemployment checks.

            Will christened the new year with a 100-mile footrace in Hawaii simply named; Hurt . He took 7th place out of several hundred and finished in 26 hours 
            and 24 minutes. This summer, he ran 93 miles around Mt. Rainier in just over 24 hours. These types of athletic feats have been a huge part of Will’s life
             ever since he was little. For the past several months though, injuries have kept him from doing anything arduous and the absence of athletic catharsis has 
             forced him to look for satisfaction in other areas of life. Lately, he’s taken to playing a strange form of basketball using old jar lids and the kitchen 
             garbage for the ball and net. His family is concerned. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With regards to the new year. Will has observed the passing of 2020 with the detached bewilderment of a bear smelling the first winds of spring. While 
            its true, his title at work generates more prestige and money than it did a year ago, those superficial measurements are perhaps the only reliable indicators of 
            progress. The tasks he’s asked to do and the asses he’s asked to kiss feel familiar. Are there greener pastures?
            <br>
            <br>
            All whinging aside, Will is at an exciting place in his career, has a loving relationship with his girlfriend of three years, and is sometimes an absolute joy to those around 
            him. He wishes you and yours all the best during these cold months.
